# Challenge #14: ðŸ¦Œ Weaving the reno

## ðŸ§  Problem instructions

Reindeer need to move to occupy the stables, but **there cannot be more than one reindeer per stable.** Additionally, to keep the reindeer comfortable, we must minimize the total distance they travel to get settled.

We have two parameters:

- `reindeer`: An array of integers representing the positions of the reindeer.
- `stables`: An array of integers representing the positions of the stables.

Each reindeer must be moved from its current position to a stable. However, it is important to note that **there can only be one reindeer per stable.**

Your task is to calculate the **minimum number of moves needed** for all the reindeer to end up in a stable.

_Note_: Keep in mind that **the stables array will always be the same size as the reindeer array** and that **the stables will always be unique.**

Example

```javascript
minMovesToStables([2, 6, 9], [3, 8, 5]); // -> 3
// Explanation:
// Reindeer at positions: 2, 6, 9
// Stables at positions: 3, 8, 5
// 1st reindeer: moves from position 2 to the stable at position 3 (1 move).
// 2nd reindeer: moves from position 6 to the stable at position 5 (1 move)
// 3rd reindeer: moves from position 9 to the stable at position 8 (1 move).
// Total moves: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 moves

minMovesToStables([1, 1, 3], [1, 8, 4]);
// Explanation:
// Reindeer at positions: 1, 1, 3
// Stables at positions: 1, 8, 4
// 1st reindeer: does not move (0 moves)
// 2nd reindeer: moves from position 1 to the stable at position 4 (3 moves)
// 3rd reindeer: moves from position 3 to the stable at position 8 (5 moves)
// Total moves: 0 + 3 + 5 = 8 moves
```

## ðŸ’¡ Approach and Solution

The `minMovesToStables` function calculates the minimum total distance required to assign reindeers to stables. This ensures that each reindeer is matched to the closest stable to minimize the total distance.

### Approach

1. **Sort Arrays**:

   - Sort both the `reindeer` and `stables` arrays in ascending order. Sorting ensures that the smallest distances are achieved when matching corresponding elements from both arrays.

2. **Iterate Through Reindeers**:

   - Loop through the `reindeer` array and compute the absolute difference between the corresponding reindeer and stable positions. This difference represents the distance a reindeer needs to move.

3. **Accumulate the Total Distance**:

   - Add up the absolute differences to calculate the total distance required for all reindeers to reach their assigned stables.

4. **Return the Total Distance**:

   - Return the accumulated distance as the result.

## ðŸŽ‰ What I Learned

- Sorting both arrays simplifies the problem of matching elements optimally.
- Using the absolute difference function (`Math.abs`) is essential for calculating distances.
- Greedy algorithms like this one are highly effective for minimizing distances in such scenarios.
