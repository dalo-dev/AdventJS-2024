# Challenge #13: ðŸ¤– Is the robot back?

## ðŸ§  Problem instructions

The elves at the North Pole have created a **special robot ðŸ¤–** that helps Santa Claus distribute gifts inside a large warehouse. **The robot moves on a 2D plane and we start from the origin (0, 0).**

We want to know if, after executing a series of movements, the robot returns to exactly where it started.

The robot's basic commands are:

- `L`: Move to the left
- `R`: Move to the right
- `U`: Move upwards
- `D`: Move downwards

But it also has certain modifiers for the movements:

- `*`: The movement is done with double intensity (e.g., `*R` means `RR`)
- `!`: The next movement is inverted (e.g., `R!L` is considered as `RR`)
- `?`: The next movement is done only if it hasn't been done before (e.g., `R?R` means `R`)

**Note:** When the movement is inverted with `!` **the inverted movement is counted and not the original one.** For example, `!U?U` inverts the `U` movement, so it counts as having done the `D` movement but not the `U`. Thus, `!U?U` translates to `D?U`, and therefore, the final `U` movement is done.

You must return:

- `true`: if the robot returns exactly to where it started
- `[x, y]`: if the robot does not return to where it started, return the position where it stopped

```javascript
isRobotBack("R"); // [1, 0]
isRobotBack("RL"); // true
isRobotBack("RLUD"); // true
isRobotBack("*RU"); // [2, 1]
isRobotBack("R*U"); // [1, 2]
isRobotBack("LLL!R"); // [-4, 0]
isRobotBack("R?R"); // [1, 0]
isRobotBack("U?D"); // true
isRobotBack("R!L"); // [2,0]
isRobotBack("U!D"); // [0,2]
isRobotBack("R?L"); // true
isRobotBack("U?U"); // [0,1]
isRobotBack("*U?U"); // [0,2]
isRobotBack("U?D?U"); // true

// Step-by-step examples:
isRobotBack("R!U?U"); // [1,0]
// 'R'  -> moves to the right
// '!U' -> inverts and becomes 'D'
// '?U' -> moves upwards, because the 'U' movement hasn't been done yet

isRobotBack("UU!U?D"); // [0,1]
// 'U'  -> moves upwards
// 'U'  -> moves upwards
// '!U' -> inverts and becomes 'D'
// '?D' -> does not move, since the 'D' movement has already been done
```

## ðŸ’¡ Approach and Solution

The `isRobotBack` function determines if a robot returns to its starting point after a series of moves. It accounts for modifiers and special cases in the move sequence.

### Approach

1. **Define Movement Rules**:

   - Use an object `movePath` to map each direction (`U`, `R`, `D`, `L`) to their respective coordinate changes and opposites.

2. **Handle Modifiers**:

   - Use an object `modifiers` to define the effects of special moves (`!` and `*`) on movement:
     - `!`: Reverses the direction by setting the modifier to `-1`.
     - `*`: Doubles the step size by setting the modifier to `2`.

3. **Iterate Through Moves**:

   - Maintain variables for the robot's current position (`currentX`, `currentY`), the current move modifier (`currentModifier`), and the previous move (`prevMove`).
   - Handle `?` as a special marker, skipping the next move if it matches the previous move.

4. **Apply Moves**:

   - For each move, update the robot's position based on the current modifier and the corresponding movement in `movePath`.
   - Reset the modifier to `1` after applying it.

5. **Check Final Position**:

   - If the robot returns to the origin (`0, 0`), return `true`. Otherwise, return the robot's final coordinates as an array `[currentX, currentY]`.

## ðŸŽ‰ What I Learned

- Introducing modifiers for movement logic increases flexibility for handling special rules.
- Accounting for opposite directions simplifies reversal mechanics.
- Testing edge cases, such as sequences with `?` and modifiers, ensures robustness.
