# Challenge #3: üèóÔ∏è Organizing the inventory

## üß† Problem instructions

Santa Claus üéÖ is checking his workshop inventory to prepare gift delivery. The elves have recorded the toys in an array of objects, but the information is a bit disorganized. You need to help Santa organize the inventory.

You will receive an array of objects, where each object represents a toy and has the properties:

- `name`: the name of the toy (string).
- `quantity`: the available quantity of that toy (integer).
- `category`: the category to which the toy belongs (string).

Write a function that processes this array and returns an object that organizes the toys as follows:

- The keys of the object will be the categories of toys.
- The values will be objects that have the toy names as keys and the total quantities of each toy in that category as values.
- If there are toys with the same name in the same category, you must sum their quantities.
- If the array is empty, the function should return an empty object {}.

```javascript
const inventory = [
  { name: "doll", quantity: 5, category: "toys" },
  { name: "car", quantity: 3, category: "toys" },
  { name: "ball", quantity: 2, category: "sports" },
  { name: "car", quantity: 2, category: "toys" },
  { name: "racket", quantity: 4, category: "sports" },
];

organizeInventory(inventory);

// Expected result:
// {
//   toys: {
//     doll: 5,
//     car: 5
//   },
//   sports: {
//     ball: 2,
//     racket: 4
//   }

const inventory2 = [
  { name: "book", quantity: 10, category: "education" },
  { name: "book", quantity: 5, category: "education" },
  { name: "paint", quantity: 3, category: "art" },
];

organizeInventory(inventory2);

// Expected result:
// {
//   education: {
//     book: 15
//   },
//   art: {
//     paint: 3
//   }
// }
```

## üí° Approach and Solution

To solve this problem, I used the following approach:

1. **Initialize the Inventory Object**:

   - I started by creating an empty object `inventoryObj`, which will hold the organized inventory. Each property of this object will represent a gift category.

2. **Iterating Over the Gifts**:

   - For each gift in the inventory, I checked if its category already exists in `inventoryObj`. If it doesn't, I used the nullish coalescing operator (`??=`) to initialize it as an empty object.

3. **Handling Each Gift Name**:

   - Once I ensured that the category exists, I checked whether the gift name already exists within that category. If it doesn‚Äôt, I initialized it with a value of `0`.

4. **Summing Quantities**:
   - After ensuring the gift category and name exist, I added the gift's quantity to the existing quantity (or started with the quantity if it was the first occurrence of the gift).

## üéâ What I Learned

- I learned how to use the nullish coalescing assignment operator (??=) to simplify checking and initializing object properties. This operator is very useful for handling default values in an elegant way.
- The challenge also deepened my understanding of how to group and aggregate data in JavaScript.
